# Prerequisites

Install the gym environment (for windows see this tutoriel https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-install-openai-gym-in-a-windows-environment-338969e24d30)

# The project

The purpose of this project is for me to implement (in tensorflow 2.0) the concept of Deep Reinforcement Learning, starting with this paper https://web.stanford.edu/class/psych209/Readings/MnihEtAlHassibis15NatureControlDeepRL.pdf and trying to go further once the basis done.<br/>
I use gym environments from OpenAI to apply this concept of Deep Reinforcement Learning on arcade games.
